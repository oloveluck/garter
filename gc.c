  Copies a Garter value from the given address to the new heap,

  Arguments:
    garter_val_addr: the *address* of some Garter value, which contains a Garter value,
                     i.e. a tagged word.  
                     It may or may not be a pointer to a heap-allocated value...
    heap_top: the location at which to begin copying, if any copying is needed

  Return value:
    The new top of the heap, at which to continue allocations

  Side effects:
    If the data needed to be copied, then this replaces the value at its old location 
    with a forwarding pointer to its new location

  Implements Cheney's garbage collection algorithm.

  Arguments:

    top_stack: the current stack pointer of the topmost Garter stack frame
